This branch of this repository contains my mapping for the Tangent plugin for Adobe Lightroom Classic.

My changes from the beta (1.6.9) mapping are:

*    Trackball dials (with Alt) -> Basic Shadow / Exposure / Highlights (note speed)
*    Centre Trackball (Alt) -> Grading - Midtone (note speed)
*    Down arrow -> Previous Knob Bank
*    Up/Down arrows (Alt) -> Change mode (note direction reversed - that made more sense!)
*    Step Back/Forward -> Undo/Redo

The main branch of this repository contains my Tangent plugin for Adobe Lightroom Classic, which is now obsolete since Tangent released their own official plugin.
